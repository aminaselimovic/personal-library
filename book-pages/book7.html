                    <p><b>A world divided. A queendom without an heir. An ancient enemy awakens.</b></p>
                    <p>The House of Berethnet has ruled Inys for a thousand years. Still unwed, Queen Sabran the Ninth must

                    <p>Ead Duryan is an outsider at court. Though she has risen to the position of lady-in-waiting, she is loyal 
                        to a hidden society of mages. Ead keeps a watchful eye on Sabran, secretly protecting her with forbidden 
                        magic.</p>
                    <p>Across the dark sea, Tané has trained to be a dragonrider since she was a child, but is forced to make a 
                        choice that could see her life unravel.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the divided East and West refuse to parley, and forces of chaos are rising from their sleep.</p>
