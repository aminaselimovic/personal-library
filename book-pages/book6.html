                    <h4>About the Author</h4>
                    <p>Sue Lynn Tan is the author of <i>Daughter of the Moon Goddess</i> and <i>Heart of the Sun Warrior.</i> Her books will be 
                        translated into seventeen languages, and are <i>USA Today</i> and <i>Sunday Times</i> bestsellers.</p>
                    <p>Born in Malaysia, Sue Lynn studied in London and France, before moving to Hong Kong with her family. 
                        Her love for stories began with a gift from her father, her first compilation of fairytales from around 
                        the world. After devouring every fable she could find in the library, she discovered fantasy books, 
                        spending much of her childhood lost in magical worlds.</p>
