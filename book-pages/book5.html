                    <h4>Book Description</h4>
                    <p><b>“Epic, romantic, and enthralling from start to finish.”—Stephanie Garber, #1 New York Times 
                        bestselling author of the Caraval series</b></p>
                    <p>Growing up on the moon, Xingyin is accustomed to solitude, unaware that she is being hidden from the 
                        feared Celestial Emperor who exiled her mother for stealing his elixir of immortality. But when Xingyin’s 
                        magic flares and her existence is discovered, she is forced to flee her home, leaving her mother behind.</p>
                    <p>Alone, powerless, and afraid, she makes her way to the Celestial Kingdom, a land of wonder and secrets. 
                        Disguising her identity, she seizes an opportunity to learn alongside the emperor’s son, mastering archery 
                        and magic, even as passion flames between her and the prince.</p>
                    <p>To save her mother, Xingyin embarks on a perilous quest, confronting legendary creatures and vicious enemies. 
                        But when treachery looms and forbidden magic threatens the kingdom, she must challenge the ruthless Celestial 
                        Emperor for her dream—striking a dangerous bargain in which she is torn between losing all she loves or 
                        plunging the realm into chaos.</p>

                    <p>Sue Lynn Tan is the author of <i>Daughter of the Moon Goddess</i> and <i>Heart of the Sun Warrior.</i> Her books will be 
                        translated into seventeen languages, and are <i>USA Today</i> and <i>Sunday Times</i> bestsellers.</p>
                    <p>Born in Malaysia, Sue Lynn studied in London and France, before moving to Hong Kong with her family. 
                        Her love for stories began with a gift from her father, her first compilation of fairytales from around 
                        the world. After devouring every fable she could find in the library, she discovered fantasy books, 
                        spending much of her childhood lost in magical worlds.</p>
