                    <h4>Book Description</h4>
                    <p>In <i>A Day of Fallen Night</i>, Samantha Shannon sweeps readers back to the universe of Priory of the Orange 
                        Tree and into the lives of four women, showing us a course of events that shaped their world for 
                        generations to come.</p>
                    <p>Tunuva Melim is a sister of the Priory. For fifty years, she has trained to slay wyrms – but none have 
                        appeared since the Nameless One, and the younger generation is starting to question the Priory's purpose.</p>
                    <p>To the north, in the Queendom of Inys, Sabran the Ambitious has married the new King of Hróth, narrowly 
                        saving both realms from ruin. Their daughter, Glorian, trails in their shadow – exactly where she wants 
                        to be.</p>
                    <p>The dragons of the East have slept for centuries. Dumai has spent her life in a Seiikinese mountain 
                        temple, trying to wake the gods from their long slumber. Now someone from her mother's past is coming 
                        to upend her fate.</p>
                    <p>When the Dreadmount erupts, bringing with it an age of terror and violence, these women must find the 
                        strength to protect humankind from a devastating threat.</p>
